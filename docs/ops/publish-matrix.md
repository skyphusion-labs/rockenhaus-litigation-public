# Private ↔ public publish matrix

**Purpose:** Make docket lag and handoff state explicit. The private repo
(`rockenhaus-litigation`) holds source markdown + evidence; this public repo
holds the **filed/served PDFs** and static rebuttal evidence that ship on
rockenhaus.net.

**Rule (Conrad 2026-08-04):** Public publish is **manual and reviewed**. There is
no CI auto-sync from private. PII gate before any new PDF lands on `main`.

**Last matrix refresh:** 2026-08-04 (P2).

## How to read this

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **published** | PDF is on public `main` under the case tree or `assets/evidence/` |
| **private-only** | Source or evidence exists privately; not on public site |
| **n/a** | Not a court filing (hub prose, FAQ, etc.) |

Regenerate the Wayne DO filed list with:

```bash
ls wayne_do_26-104594-DO/filed/*.pdf | wc -l
```

## Cases on the public site

| Case | Public PDF roots | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wayne DO `26-104594-DO` | `wayne_do_26-104594-DO/filed/`, `opposing/`, `orders/` | Primary active docket |
| Washtenaw DO `26-737-DO` | `washtenaw_do_26-737-DO/filed/` | Reference / companion |
| Wayne PPO `26-102221-PP` | (retired from public index) | Historical; not re-expanded here |

## Wayne DO -- Conrad numbered filings (source markdown vs public PDF)

Private sources live under  
`rockenhaus-litigation/cases/wayne_do_26-104594-DO/filings/*.md`.  
Public PDFs live under `wayne_do_26-104594-DO/filed/*.pdf`.

**As of 2026-08-04:** every private numbered filing markdown that maps to a
public PDF basename is **published** through **46** (incl. **41k**, **43-46**).
No private-only numbered filing gap detected by basename/`N_` prefix match.

High-water mark on public:

| Filing | Title (filename) | Public path | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 39 | Motion Appoint GAL for Plaintiff | `.../filed/39_Motion_Appoint_GAL_for_Plaintiff_2026-07-02.pdf` | published |
| 41k | ePraecipe Accepted GAL Capacity 8-26 | `.../filed/41k_ePraecipe_Accepted_GAL_Capacity_8-26_Hearing_2026-07-28.pdf` | published |
| 43 | Notice of Hearing GAL 8-26 | `.../filed/43_Notice_of_Hearing_GAL_8-26_2026-08-03.pdf` | published |
| 44 | Proof of Service GAL | `.../filed/44_Proof_of_Service_GAL_2026-08-03.pdf` | published |
| 45 | Consolidated NOH In Person 8-26 | `.../filed/45_Consolidated_Notice_of_Hearing_In_Person_8-26_2026-08-04.pdf` | published |
| 46 | Proof of Service NOH In Person | `.../filed/46_Proof_of_Service_NOH_In_Person_2026-08-04.pdf` | published |

Full directory: [wayne_do_26-104594-DO/filed/](../../wayne_do_26-104594-DO/filed/)
(~108 PDFs including exhibits, ePraecipes, opposing-side copies filed under
case tree).

## Death-hoax claim letters (evidence, not court filings)

VA EMMS best copies of false death-hoax notices. **PII review (Conrad 2026-08-04):**
cleared for public hosting; third-party names also appear on the .cc site and in
filed pleadings. The 27 July 2026 letter's Social Security number field was
redacted on 2026-09-23 (image and text layer). The other four letters in this
directory were checked the same day and do not contain that number. The private
repo still holds the unredacted custody copy; do not overwrite this public PDF
from that original without repeating the redaction.

| Artifact | Public path | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ClaimLetter-2026-05-04.pdf | `/assets/evidence/death_hoax_claim_letters/ClaimLetter-2026-05-04.pdf` | published (P2) |
| ClaimLetter-2026-06-29.pdf | `/assets/evidence/death_hoax_claim_letters/ClaimLetter-2026-06-29.pdf` | published (P2) |
| ClaimLetter-2026-06-29-2.pdf | `/assets/evidence/death_hoax_claim_letters/ClaimLetter-2026-06-29-2.pdf` | published (P2) |
| ClaimLetter-2026-07-16.pdf | `/assets/evidence/death_hoax_claim_letters/ClaimLetter-2026-07-16.pdf` | published (P2) |
| ClaimLetter-2026-07-27.pdf | `/assets/evidence/death_hoax_claim_letters/ClaimLetter-2026-07-27.pdf` | published (P2), SSN field redacted 2026-09-23 |
| Index page | `/is-conrad-rockenhaus-dead/claim-letters/` | published (P2) |

Private source (still canonical for chain of custody notes):  
`rockenhaus-litigation/evidence/death_hoax_claim_letters/`.

## Other public evidence (not in case tree)

| Artifact | Path | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AAdvantage account update email | `/assets/evidence/aadvantage-account-update-email-2026-06-10.pdf` | published |
| Retraction demand PDFs | under `/retractions/` | published |

## AI Search corpus

| Item | Location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page text corpus | `_corpus/` in this repo | Committed; verified in CI |
| R2 bucket | `rockenhaus-search-public` | Synced from `_corpus/` for search-mcp |
| Query Worker | `https://search.rockenhaus.net` | Widget on `/ask/` |

After adding new **filed** PDFs: regenerate site (`generate_site.py`), rebuild
corpus (`build-corpus.mjs`), commit, merge, then re-sync R2 + reindex AI Search.

## Handoff checklist (new filing PDF)

1. Private: build PDF from markdown (CI on private `main` or local).
2. PII scan (names, SSNs, account numbers, sealed exhibits).
3. Copy PDF into the correct public case folder (`filed/` / `opposing/` / `orders/`).
4. PR on this repo; CI green; merge.
5. Confirm Pages deploy + dual-host cache purge.
6. If corpus text is needed for answers/search: rebuild `_corpus` and re-sync search.
